## Predicted music app user churn rates
1. Performed ETL to clean and feature engineer unstructured app user behavior events data 

2. Built ensemble models e.g., random forest 

3. Conducted cost-benefit analysis for best retention strategy

## Built a song recommendation system employing collaborative filtering
1. Cleaned 14G unstructured log files from smartphones (1.6 billion rows) utilizing text mining

2. Constructed implicit rating scores with a user ad-hoc quantile algorithm and rectified cold start issues by using
content-based and popularity-based methods
